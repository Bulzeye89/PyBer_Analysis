# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
### Background
The purpose of this dive into PyBer ride-sharing data to is garner insights for the company's decision makers which will help them steer a path for PyBer's future and growth. This early probe will specifically be looking what the data tells us about fares, rides, and drivers per city type.  City type is classified as rural, suburban, or urban.  

### Resources
-Data Source: [city_data.csv](https://github.com/Bulzeye89/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/city_data.csv), [ride_data.csv](https://github.com/Bulzeye89/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/ride_data.csv)<br>
-Software: Python 3.7.11, Anaconda 4.12.0, JupyterLab 3.3.2

## Results
Some key findings after aggregating and analyzing the data are:
- There are almost 5 times as many urban drivers as suburban drivers and 30 times as many urban drivers as rural drivers.
- There are 2.6 more total urban rides than suburan rides and 13 times more total urban rides than total rural rides.
- The average urban fare is 29% less than the average rural fare and 21% less than the average suburan fare. 
- The average fare per urban driver is 70% less than the average fare per rural driver and 58% less than the average fare per suburban driver. 
- 62% of total fares and 68% of total rides are from urban cities while 80% of drivers are based in urban cities as seen in the graphs below.
-On a weekly basis, urban fares consistently outpace rural fares by 4 times and suburban fares by 2 times as seen in the graph below.

## Summary: 
In an effort to uphold state testing standards in light of the evidence of academic dishonesty, only small fractional percentage changes were made that ultimately had no significant change to results of the data.  The school board can be advised that the 9th grade students from Thomas High School reading and math scores have been removed.  With the removal of the data, Thomas High still ranked second out of all the schools while other insights of the analysis held true and and virtually almost unchanged such as the district's overall scores, 9th grade overall scores, school sizes scores, and charter school scores.  In addition, I would like to note that while the scores of the 9th grade Thomas High students were changed to Nans, their count was not deducted from overall student count column as this would have affected other things suchs as per student budget.
